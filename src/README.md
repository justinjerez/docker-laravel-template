# PHP/Laravel Project

This is where your PHP/Laravel project goes. To get started, delete this `README.md` and follow one of the next instructions:

- If you want to use an existing project, clone it or copy all the files directly into this `src` directory.
- To use a new laravel project, open a new terminal outside this `src` directory and run the following command `docker-compose run --rm composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .` and this will create the new laravel project inside the `src` directory.

In case of a PHP project, make sure that the `index.php` file that boostrap your applications is inside a `public` folder.

Once the project is placed inside the `src` directory go back to the main `README.md` file and follow the instruction that goes next.
